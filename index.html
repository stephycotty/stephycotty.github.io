									<h2><a href="#">Research Interest<br />
									</a></h2>
									<p>My research is driven by a passion for harnessing computational science and engineering to address real-world challenges through intelligent, data-driven solutions. I am particularly interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, and data mining, where powerful algorithms meet complex systems to produce actionable insights.

										My focus lies in developing and applying optimization algorithms, simulation techniques, and predictive modeling approaches to solve high-impact problems across various domains. These include healthcare diagnostics and decision support, smart energy systems, autonomous vehicle perception and navigation, and environmental sustainability. By bridging theory with practice, I aim to contribute to the advancement of scalable and interpretable AI technologies that are both innovative and ethically responsible.</p>

										House Pricing Prediction</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="house_image.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In my project, I utilized house pricing forecast using linear regression, a predictive modeling technique aimed at estimating future house prices based on historical data and various influencing factors. This approach leverages linear regression, a fundamental statistical method in machine learning, to analyze the relationship between house prices and key features such as size, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant attributes. By applying linear regression, I was able to uncover patterns and trends in the data, enabling accurate predictions of future house prices based on these essential features.</p>

										Clustering Analysis </a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="clustering_image.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I conducted a clustering analysis on a dataset of countries to categorize them according to their economic attributes. Using K-means clustering, I uncovered distinct groups that highlighted patterns of similarity and disparity in economic performance worldwide. The analysis offered valuable insights into global economic trends and the factors shaping each clusterâ€™s profile. Through visual representations, I showcased how clustering can simplify the interpretation of complex data, while also strengthening my proficiency in data analysis and visualization using Python, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.</p>

									</a>
									<p>In this project, I analyzed NBA rookie data to predict the likelihood that a player would remain in the league for at least five years, using the target variable. The objective was to develop and compare predictive models that capture the relationships between various independent variables and the probability of long-term career retention. I employed Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and Neural Network algorithms to identify the most effective approach. The workflow included data acquisition, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model development, evaluation, visualization, and result interpretation.</p>

										Music Genre Classification</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="musical_image.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I developed a hybrid deep learning model combining Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with a Swin Transformer to classify music genres from spectrogram images. The CNN captured local spatial features, while the Swin Transformer leveraged attention mechanisms to model long-range dependencies and global patterns. This hybrid architecture significantly improved genre classification accuracy compared to baseline models, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining convolutional and transformer-based approaches for audio-based image recognition tasks.</p>

									</a>
									<p>The innovation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) has brought transformative changes to the transportation sector, improving safety, efficiency, and convenience. At the core of effective AV functionality is the ability to accurately detect and recognize surrounding objects through computer vision. In this project, I focused on enhancing object detection performance using YOLOv5 an advanced deep learning algorithm renowned for its real-time accuracy. My primary goal was to develop a model specifically optimized for detecting cars in diverse and challenging environments. Through meticulous data collection, preprocessing, training, and validation, I achieved notable improvements in detection accuracy and overall model reliability.</p>

									<p> In this project, I used R programming to analyze the 2021 England Census data and examine the complex interplay between education level, ethnicity, age, and income. My goal was to uncover patterns that reveal how these factors influence income distribution across different demographic groups. I was particularly interested in how educational attainment and ethnic background affect socioeconomic outcomes, and how age further shapes these dynamics. By applying statistical analysis and visualization techniques in R, I gained valuable insights into the social and economic disparities and similarities that exist among various populations. This investigation deepened my understanding of real-world data and strengthened my ability to use R for meaningful, data-driven storytelling.</p>

									<p>In this project, I used R programming to analyze the Melanoma dataset, focusing on patients treated at the University Hospital of Odense, Denmark. I explored how factors like tumor thickness, age, sex, and ulcer presence impact survival outcomes. Through summary statistics, visualizations, regression, and correlation analysis, I uncovered key patterns that can inform predictive models and support better treatment strategies. This study enhanced my skills in statistical analysis and deepened my interest in applying data science to healthcare.</p>
